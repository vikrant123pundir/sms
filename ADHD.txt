- get ready to go to sleep. meaning, let your mind know. ex. start getting dressed to go to sleep, brush your teeth, get into comfy clothes. and think about going to sleep.
- exercise
- guided meditation
- If i write down everything Iâ€™m obsessing over, every train of thought, line by line, that usually helps!
- think about day step by step

- It took a long time for me to realize my racing thoughts occurred in direct relation to my level of under or over stimulation. Idk which you're having, but try to treat either and see if it helps.

Under stimulation is like you feel the urge to do things that provide stimulation. This is what can cause impulsiveness in adhd to a degree. For example, if you were sitting in a quiet room with nothing going on, you might feel a strong need to get up and do something.

Over stimulation is more like having too much input going on that makes you want to get away from it. For example, if you were in a crowded room with people talking loudly and you started to feel overwhelmed.

something happens	---affects emotions ----> i act as per that.
					----doesn't affect emotions ---> i don't act as per other	(best)
					-----affects emotions ---i look inward my actions ---> don't act as per other (second best : but might lead to suppression of emotions)
